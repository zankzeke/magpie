## How do I get Magpie? ##

There are currently two options for installing Magpie

### Building from Source ###

### Downloading a Precompiled Version ###

A complete version of Magpie that has already been compiled is available for **[download](http://oqmd.org/static/analytics/magpie/Magpie.zip)**. Since Magpie is written entirely in Java, this version should work without modification on any system with the Java Runtime Environment installed.
