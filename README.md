Magpie, the Materials-Agnostic Platform for Informatics and Exploration, is designed to simplify the use of machine learning to predict properties of materials. 

## How do I learn to use Magpie? ##

Documentation for Magpie is available on [oqmd.org](http://oqmd.org/static/analytics/magpie/doc/)

## How do I get Magpie? ##

There are currently two options for obtaining a working copy of Magpie

### Building from Source ###

First, download or clone a copy of this repository from BitBucket. For convenience, all necessary libraries are contained within this repository. Once downloaded, compile Magpie by copying "simple-build.xml" to "build.xml" and calling [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) using the command
```
#!shell

ant jar

### Downloading a Precompiled Version ###

A complete version of Magpie that has already been compiled is available for [download](http://oqmd.org/static/analytics/magpie/Magpie.zip). Since Magpie is written entirely in Java, this version should work without modification on any system with the Java Runtime Environment installed.
